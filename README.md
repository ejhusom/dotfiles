# Vim configuration

This repository contains my complete Vim configuration. Feel free to use it (or
parts of it), or just get some ideas of what is possible with Vim.

## Installation

1. Clone repository in your home folder, into a directory called `.vim`:
```
git clone https://github.com/ejhusom/dotvim .vim
```
2. Create symlink:
```
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

Alternative to creating symlink: Just move/copy the `.vimrc` file to your home folder.
